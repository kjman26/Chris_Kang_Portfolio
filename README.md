Motivation and Purpose: The goal of this challenge is to create an interactive profile to showcase myself and my work portfolios.

I built this website  because it allows employers to see information about me when looking for candidates.

It will solve the issue of employers not knowing who I am and it also displays my previous work to evaluate my skill and performance.

What I have learned:
    1. how to utilize flex box properties
    2. how to format a profile page
    3. how to add background images 
    4. how to place boxes inside of other boxes with proper alignment
    5. how to correctly order and tag HTML such that it ligns up with CSS
    6. 

What makes my project standout is:
    1. It is ME and there is only one ME!
    2. The use of different background images
    3. My personal info

Usage: 
    1. hover over individual boxes to highlight
    2. select from nav bar to move to that section
    3. click boxes to link to other sites (only 1 for now)
    4. click links at bottom to contact me and/or access my profiles]
